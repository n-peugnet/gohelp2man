.TH GOHELP2MAN 1 2025-11-09 "gohelp2man v0.6.0"
.SH NAME
gohelp2man \- generate a simple manual page for Go programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgohelp2man\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... EXECUTABLE
.SH DESCRIPTION
gohelp2man generates a man page out of a Go program's \fB\-help\fP output.
.PP
Go has a simple but very effective "flag" package that can be used to quickly
create CLI applications without any additional dependencies. But this package
cannot generate man pages.
.PP
gohelp2man takes inspiration from GNU help2man, and generates a man page from
the \fB\-help\fP output of your Go program. It is specifically designed to recognise
the help message generated by the "flag" package.
.PP
It is a great match with "go get \fB\-tool\fP" and "go generate"!
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
\fB\-help\fR
Show this help and exit.
.TP
\fB\-include\fR FILE
Include material from FILE.
.TP
\fB\-manual\fR SECTION
Set the name of the manual section to SECTION, used as a centred
heading for the manual page. By default it is omitted to let \fBman\fP(1)
fill it accordingly. Commonly used values are "User Commands" for
pages in section 1, "Games" for section 6 and "System Administration
Utilities" for sections 8 and 1M.
.TP
\fB\-name\fR string
Description for the NAME paragraph.
.TP
\fB\-opt\-include\fR FILE
A variant of \fB\-include\fP which does not require FILE to exist.
.TP
\fB\-output\fR FILE
Send output to FILE rather than stdout.
.TP
\fB\-section\fR NUMBER
Set the section of the manual page to NUMBER (e.g. 1, 6 or 8). See
\fBman\fP(1) for common section numbers. (default "1")
.TP
\fB\-version\fR
Show version number and exit.
.TP
\fB\-version\-string\fR VERSION
Set the VERSION to use in the footer.
.SH INCLUDE FILES
Additional material may be included in the generated output with the
.B \-include
and
.B \-opt\-include
options.  The format is simple:

    [section]
    text

    /pattern/
    text

Blocks of verbatim *roff text are inserted into the output either at
the start of the given
.BI [ section ]
(case insensitive).
.PP
Lines before the first section are silently ignored and may be
used for comments, RCS keywords and the like.
.PP
The section output order (for those included) is:

    NAME
    SYNOPSIS
    DESCRIPTION
    OPTIONS
    \fIother\fR
    ENVIRONMENT
    FILES
    EXAMPLES
    AUTHOR
    REPORTING BUGS
    COPYRIGHT
    SEE ALSO

Any
.B [NAME]
or
.B [SYNOPSIS]
sections appearing in the include file will replace what would have
automatically been produced (although you can still override the
former with
.B \-name
if required).
.PP
Other sections are prepended to the automatically produced output for
the standard sections given above, or included at
.I other
(above) in the order they were encountered in the include file.
.PP
Placement of the text within the section may be explicitly requested by using
the syntax
.RI [< section ],
.RI [= section ]
or
.RI [> section ]
to place the additional text before, in place of, or after the default
output respectively.
.SH DIFFERENCES WITH HELP2MAN
gohelp2man is mostly a copy of
.BR help2man (1),
but there are a few differences. Here is the full list (might change in the future):
.IP (1) 5
gohelp2man is dedicated to parse the output of the "flag" package of Go's stdlib,
whereas help2man is focused on parsing GNU style options.
.IP (2)
gohelp2man does not support the
.BI / pattern /\fR
feature of help2man's include files.
.IP (3)
gohelp2man does not support the additional options feature of help2man's include files.
.IP (4)
gohelp2man flags do not have shorthands and some flags from help2man are missing:
.RS
.TP
.B \-\-source
.TP
.B \-\-locale
.TP
.B \-\-info\-page
N/A (info pages are never mentionned)
.TP
.B \-\-no\-info
N/A (info pages are never mentionned)
.TP
.B \-\-libtool
N/A (meaningless in the context of Go programs)
.TP
.B \-\-help\-option
.TP
.B \-\-version\-option
N/A (Go programs are not expected to have a version flag)
.TP
.B \-\-no\-discard\-stderr
N/A (stderr is always taken into account)
.RE
.SH ENVIRONMENT
These environment variables can influence the behaviour of gohelp2man.
.TP
\fBGOH2M_DEBUG\fR
Set to a non-empty value to enable debug mode.
.TP
\fBGOH2M_OPTIONS\fR
gohelp2man will parse command line arguments listed in this variable
before any command option (as if they had been prepended to the command
line arguments).
.TP
\fBSOURCE_DATE_EPOCH\fR
Will override the current timestamp if set.
