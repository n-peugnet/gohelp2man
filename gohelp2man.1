.TH GOHELP2MAN 1 "2025-11-06" "gohelp2man v0.5.0"
.SH NAME
gohelp2man \- generate a simple manual page for Go programs
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgohelp2man\fR [\fIOPTION\fR]... EXECUTABLE
.SH DESCRIPTION
gohelp2man generates a man page out of a Go program's \-help output.
.PP
Go has a simple but very effective "flag" package that can be used to quickly
create CLI applications without any additional dependencies. But this package
cannot generate man pages.
.PP
gohelp2man takes inspiration from GNU help2man, and generates a man page from
the \-help output of your Go program. It is specifically designed to recognise
the help message generated by the "flag" package.
.PP
It is a great match with "go get \-tool" and "go generate"!
