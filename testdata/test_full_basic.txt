gohelp2man generates a man page out of a Go program's -help output.

Go has a simple but very effective "flag" package that can be used to quickly
create CLI applications without any additional dependencies. But this package
cannot generate man pages.

gohelp2man takes inspiration from GNU help2man, and generates a man page from
the -help output of your Go program. It is specifically designed to recognise
the help message generated by the "flag" package.

It is a great match with "go get -tool" and "go generate"!

Usage: gohelp2man [OPTION]... EXECUTABLE
  -help
    	Show this help and exit.
  -include FILE
    	Include material from FILE.
  -name string
    	Description for the NAME paragraph.
  -output FILE
    	Send output to FILE rather than stdout.
  -section uint
    	Section number for manual page (1, 6, 8). See also man(1) and man-pages(7). (default 1)
  -version
    	Show version number and exit.
